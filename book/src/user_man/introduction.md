# Introduction

Blockchains are long running-processes that are continually creating new data. For this reason, any process that wishes to watch, monitor, or index a blockchain must also be long running.

**Khedra** is such a long-running process.

Because we beleive that blockchains were intended to decentralize and make permissionless not only the data but also *access to the data*. We beleive blockchains must be run locally--by end users. This is the only way to ensure that the end user--the people at the very edge of the system--can not only see that data, but also verify that it's correct.

TrueBlocks (of which **Chifra** and **Khedra** are a part) is a set of tools that helps users who are running their own blockchain nodes to make better use of the data. It works by indexing the data, and then by providing tools (including a built-in binary cache) to use that data in a variety of ways.

Of primary importance are:

- speed
- permisionless access
- accuracy
- depth of detail
- ease of use
