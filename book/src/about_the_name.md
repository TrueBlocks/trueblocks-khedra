# About the Name

The name **khedra** (prononced *kɛd-ɾɑ*) is inspired by the Persian word <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> خدمت </span> (*khedmat*), meaning "service."

In ancient Persian culture, service was considered a noble pursuit, emphasizing dedication, reliability, and humility in action. Drawing from this tradition, the name **khedra** embodies the essence of a system designed to serve--efficiently, continuously, and with purpose.

Simliar to its counterpart, [chifra](https://chifra.trueblocks.io) (derived from the Persian word for "cipher"), the name **khedra** symbolizes a long-running, dependable processes that tirelessly "serves" the needs of its users.

More technically, **khedra** is a collection of go routines that:

- creates and publishes the Unchained Index,
- monitors a user-provided customized list of addresses automating caching, notifications, and other ETL processes,
- provides a RESTful API exposing [chifra's](https://chifra.trueblocks.io) many data access commands,
- allows for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming these individual services.

By choosing the name **khedra**, we honor a legacy of service while committing to building tools that are as resilient, adaptive, and reliable as the meaning behind its name.
