# About the Name

The name **khedra** (pronounced *key-drah*) is inspired by the Persian word <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> خدمت </span> (*khedmat*), meaning "service."

In ancient Persian culture, service was considered a noble pursuit, emphasizing dedication, reliability, and humility in action. Drawing from this tradition, the name **khedra** embodies the essence of a system designed to serve—efficiently, continuously, and with purpose.

Like its counterpart, [chifra](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core) (derived from the Persian word for "cipher"), the name **khedra** connects deeply to our roots while adapting to a modern technological context. The streamlined spelling symbolizes long-running, dependable processes that tirelessly "serves" the needs of its users.

More technically, **khedra** literally is a collection of services including:

- an address appearance indexer, 
- a publisher (to both IPFS and a smart contract) of the index, 
- an address monitoring and notification tool, 
- a RESTful API exposing `chifra`'s command line options,
- and an IPFS daemon.

By choosing the name **khedra**, we honor a legacy of service while committing to building tools that are as resilient, adaptive, and reliable as the meaning behind its name.
