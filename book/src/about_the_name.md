# About the Name

The name **khedra** (pronounced *kay-drah*) is inspired by the Persian word <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> خدمت </span> (*khedmat*), meaning "service."

In ancient Persian culture (my childrens' grandfather is Persian), service was considered a noble pursuit, emphasizing dedication, reliability, and humility in action. Drawing from this tradition, the name **khedra** embodies the essence of a system designed to serve--efficiently, continuously, and with purpose.

Simliar to its counterpart, [chifra](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core) (derived from the Persian word for "cipher"), the name **khedra** connects to our roots while adapting to a modern context. The name symbolizes a long-running, dependable processes that tirelessly "serves" the needs of its users.

More technically, **khedra** is a collection of persistant go routines that:

- creates the Unchained Index,
- publishes the index to IPFS and a manifest of the resultant hashes to a smart contract,
- monitors customized lists of addresses automating caching, notifications, and other ETL processes,
- provides a RESTful API exposing `chifra`'s many data access commands,
- allows for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming these individual services.

By choosing the name **khedra**, we honor a legacy of service while committing to building tools that are as resilient, adaptive, and reliable as the meaning behind its name.
