# The Khedra Book

**Khedra** (prononced *kɛd-ɾɑ*) is an all-in-one "long-running" tool for indexing and sharing the Unchained Index and monitoring individual addresses on EVM-compatible blockchains.

The tool creates and shares the [Unchained Index](https://trueblocks.io/papers/2023/specification-for-the-unchained-index-v2.0.0-release.pdf)
which is a permissionless index of "address appearances," including appearances in event logs, execution traces, incoming transactions, modifications to smart contract state, staking or block rewards, prefund allocations and many other locations.

This detailed indexing allows for near-perfect monitoring and notifications of address activity, which leads to many benefits. The benefits include native and ERC-20 account balance histories, address auditing and accounting, and even custom indexing. It works for any address on any chain (as long as you have access to the chain's RPC).

*Enjoy!*
