# The Khedra Book

**Khedra** (pronounced *key-drah*) is an all-in-one tool for indexing and monitoring EVM-compatible blockchains.

It creates and shares the [Unchained Index](https://trueblocks.io/papers/2023/specification-for-the-unchained-index-v2.0.0-release.pdf)
which is a permissionless index of "address appearances" shared via IPFS and published to a smart contract.

Address appearances record every location in a blockchain's history including appearing in an event log, appearing in an execution trace, winning a staking or block reward, appearing as a prefund address or any other location.

This detailed indexing allows for near-perfect monitoring and notifications of addresses, native and ERC-20 account balance auditing and accounting, and even your own custom indexing needs. It works for any address on any chain (if you have access to the chain's RPC).

Enjoy.
